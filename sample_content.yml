faq:
  question1: "Do you offer same-day service?"
  answer1: "We can cut material for you on the spot on the same day you place the order. We pride ourselves on fast and friendly service; we’ll have you loaded up in 20-60 minutes. However, large orders may require next day completion."
  question2: "Can you hold or store my order after it’s purchased?"
  answer2: "Yes, we offer 3 days free storage from the date of purchase or the date the order is complete. After the first 3 days, a fee of $25 per day will be applied to any order that has not been picked up in its entirety. *Any applicable storage fees must be paid in full before materials will be released."
  question3: "What about custom fabrication?"
  answer3: "Custom fabrication is not offered as a same-day service. We require a rendering or drawing of the scope of the project in order to give you a precise quote. Our quoting process can take 1-2 days, and once complete, you’ll have a price and lead time. Depending on the complexity of the project, custom work takes 2-10 to complete."
  question4: "Do you offer installation?"
  answer4: "Yes, we’re highly experienced in installation. To get started, call and we'll send a fabricator to your site, and they’ll provide a free, custom quote within 1-2 days. Installation projects can take 2-6 weeks to complete depending on scheduling and scope of project."
